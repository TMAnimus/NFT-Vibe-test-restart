# Code Guidelines for AI Agents and Contributors

- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Prefer modular and reusable components/functions.
- Follow established naming conventions for files, variables, and functions.
- Avoid code duplication; reuse existing solutions when possible.
- Write concise and meaningful commit messages.
- Add comments where logic is non-obvious or complex.
- Ensure all code passes linting and automated tests before submission.
- Use consistent formatting (indentation, spacing, etc.) throughout the codebase.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Keep functions and files focused; avoid large, monolithic code blocks.
- Remove unused code, variables, and imports.
- Document public APIs and modules with clear usage examples if appropriate.

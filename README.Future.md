# Future Expansion Ideas

## 1. Copyright Lawsuit Event
- Satirical event where a major corporation or artist sues NFT holders for “copyright infringement” over the use of a potato, sock, or other absurd NFT “thing.”
- Effects:
  - Decreases value of affected NFTs (e.g., 0.7x multiplier) for 3–5 days.
  - Targets specific "things" (e.g., Potato, Sock) or high-volume NFTs.
  - If the lawsuit is “settled” or “dismissed,” affected NFTs get a temporary value boost (e.g., 1.2x) due to notoriety.
  - If the lawsuit “succeeds,” NFTs remain devalued longer or are temporarily delisted.
- Satirical flavor text: “MegaCorp sues over the unauthorized use of digital potatoes. The NFT market trembles in fear (and laughter)!”
- Rare event (e.g., 0.03 probability, monthly).
- Optional: Players can “fight” the lawsuit (pay a fee for a chance to win), or meme the event for a positive outcome.

## 2. NFT Fusions
- Allow players to combine two NFTs to create a new, hybrid NFT with mixed attributes and a unique image.
- Fusion could cost in-game currency and have a chance of rare outcomes.

## 3. Seasonal Events
- Add special events for holidays (e.g., “Crypto Christmas,” “Meme Halloween”) with unique limited-edition NFTs and market effects.

## 4. NFT Lending & Renting
- Enable players to lend or rent NFTs to others for a fee, with smart contract-inspired mechanics.

## 5. Meme Wars
- Weekly or monthly meme competitions where players submit and vote on the funniest NFT descriptions or images. Winners get rewards or special NFTs.

## 6. Dynamic NFT Art
- Integrate generative art so NFT images can change based on market events, owner actions, or random triggers.

## 7. DAO Governance
- Let players vote on new features, events, or rule changes using their NFT holdings as voting power.

## 8. NFT Backgrounds & Expressions with Rarity Modifiers
- Expand the NFT system to include backgrounds and expressions as core attributes, each with their own rarity and price modifiers.
- Example: A "Metaverse Mansion" background or "Diamond Vision" expression could increase an NFT's value based on rarity.
- Update the NFT config and pricing logic to factor in these new modifiers.
- Adds more variety and strategy to NFT creation and trading.

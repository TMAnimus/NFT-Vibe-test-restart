# Milestone 4: Marketplace Development

This milestone implements the core NFT marketplace backend and front-end, including listing, browsing, purchasing, filtering, and comprehensive tests. All requirements are met and verified.

## Features to Implement
- Players can list NFTs for sale with a specified price.
- Browsing system for available NFTs with filtering (colorRarity, propRarity, blockchain, price, etc).
- Purchase mechanism: ownership transfer, balance updates, and listing status changes.
- Price suggestion logic based on NFT attributes and market data.
- API endpoints for listing, browsing, and purchasing 
- Modern front-end for browsing/filtering NFTs (`client/marketplace.html`, `client/js/marketplace.js`, `client/styles/marketplace.css`).
- All major backend and front-end requirements for the marketplace are complete.

## Testing
- Comprehensive Jest tests for all marketplace routes and logic, including:
  - Listing creation and validation
  - Browsing and filtering
  - Purchasing (including concurrency/race conditions)
- Test files:
  - `server/tests/routes/listing.test.js`
  - `server/tests/routes/browsing.test.js`
  - `server/tests/routes/listings.test.js`

## Documentation
- API documentation: `server/docs/marketplace-api.md`

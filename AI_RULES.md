# AI Contribution Rules

To ensure consistency and quality when using AI tools or agents in this project, please follow these rules:

1. **Explain what you'll do first and ask for confirmation before coding.**
   - Always outline your intended approach and wait for user approval before making changes.

2. **Do the simple thing first. Use modules instead of just a single file.**
   - Prefer modular code organization for maintainability and clarity.

3. **Only make requested changes.**
   - Do not introduce unrequested features or modifications.

4. **Do not write duplicate code â€“ please look for existing solutions in the codebase.**
   - Reuse existing code and patterns whenever possible to avoid redundancy.

**Additionally, all AI agents and contributors must follow the code guidelines in [CODE_GUIDELINES.cursorrules](CODE_GUIDELINES.cursorrules).**
